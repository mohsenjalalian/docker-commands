### Instructions

* [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file)
* [FROM](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from) Sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions.
* [MAINTAINER (deprecated - use LABEL instead)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#maintainer-deprecated) Set the Author field of the generated images.
* [RUN](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run) execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results.
* [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) provide defaults for an executing container.
* [EXPOSE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose) informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.  NOTE: does not actually make ports accessible.
* [ENV](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env) sets environment variable.
* [ADD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add) copies new files, directories or remote file to container.  Invalidates caches. Avoid `ADD` and use `COPY` instead.
* [COPY](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) copies new files or directories to container.  Note that this only copies as root, so you have to chown manually regardless of your USER / WORKDIR setting.  See https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/30110
* [ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint) configures a container that will run as an executable.
* [VOLUME](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#volume) creates a mount point for externally mounted volumes or other containers.
* [USER](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user) sets the user name for following RUN / CMD / ENTRYPOINT commands.
* [WORKDIR](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir) sets the working directory.
* [ARG](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg) defines a build-time variable.
* [ONBUILD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#onbuild) adds a trigger instruction when the image is used as the base for another build.
* [STOPSIGNAL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#stopsignal) sets the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit.
* [LABEL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/labels-custom-metadata/) apply key/value metadata to your images, containers, or daemons.
